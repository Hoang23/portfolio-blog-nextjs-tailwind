The Lighting Portal is a series of digital asset management tools to help local governments make better informed decisions about public lighting.

The project consisted of taking responsibility for the rebranding by bringing user interface designs to the web portal.

Further involvement includes reimplementation of a new charting libary and adding automated testing workflows.
